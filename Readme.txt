Compare sides and diagonals of n sided polygons to find any matching metallic ratios (eg golden ratio, silver ratio and so on)

Enter a number between 3 and a 1000 and press start. The listbox will be filled out with polygons that have metallic ratios. The ratio is found from comparing their sides with its diagonals. For example: the pentagon's side compared to the 2nd diagonal has the golden ratio of 1.6180339887.
Click on a row to view the matching polygon with its sides and diagonals highlighted in the colour of the ratio.

This project was motivated by a youtube video:

 on the search for polygons with bronze ratios or other metallic ratios than silver or gold. None have ever been found.

This project is written within Visual Studio 2017 using C# .NET and wpf.
